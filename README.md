## RAG
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) combines the capabilities of a **large language model** with a **vector-based retrieval system** to generate responses. The LLM uses relevant information retrieved from PDFs to provide accurate and contextually meaningful answers to user prompts.<br>
## Step-by-Step Explanation of RAG in Bruno
- ### Extracting Text from PDF
  Uses ```PyPDF2``` to extract text from each page of a provided PDF file, combining it into a single string.
- ### Setting up LLM
  Sets up an instance of GradientBaseModelLLM using the ```llama2-7b-chat``` model, provided by the Gradient platform
- ### Setting up Embedding Model
  Sets up an instance of GradientEmbedding using the ```bge-large``` model, an embedding model used for vector representations.
- ### Document Loading
  The extracted text from the PDF is loaded as a Document object with a metadata field "name": "PDF Document".
- ### Vector Store Index and Query Engine
  A VectorStoreIndex is created from the Document objects, which is a data structure that stores the text and its corresponding vector representations. A query engine allows querying the index using natural language prompts.
- ### Querying the Index
  The query engine is queried with the provided prompt, and the response is stored.
- ### Extracting Refined Answer
  The extract_refined_answer function is called that searches for specific patterns in the text to extract the "refined answer" generated by the LLM.
